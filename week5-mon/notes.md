## Trees and BSTs

### What are trees?
Trees are made up of nodes and "edges" (connections between nodes). Each node has one parent, and any number of children. Think family tree if humans reproduced individually. Or a family tree of one gender (Great grandma Susan had three daughters, Molly, Jo, and Sally, who each had two daughters).

All tree's have a 'root': the 'root' is a special node. It's the one node that doesn't have a parent, i.e. it's parent is null. The root is kind of like the "head" for a linked list; it's our access point to the data in our data structure.

Here's an example of a tree:
